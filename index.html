<h1>Git - The Basics</h1> <!-- headline -->
Git is a version-control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people.

Git is a Distributed Version Control System. Every user “clones” a copy of a repository (a collection of files) and has the full history of the project on their own hard drive. This clone has all of the metadata of the original while the original itself is stored on a self-hosted server or a third party hosting service like GitHub.

Git helps you keep track of the changes you make to your code. It is basically the history tab for your code editor(With no incognito mode ??). If at any point while coding you hit a fatal error and don’t know what’s causing it you can always revert back to the stable state. So it is very helpful for debugging. Or you can simply see what changes you made to your code over time.

Git also helps you synchronise code between multiple people.
